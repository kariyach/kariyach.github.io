## Projects

### 1. The Reception of Rhetoric in Eighteenth‐Century Britain

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=70%}

The research project is to elucidate how rhetoric, which was invented in ancient Greece, developed in ancient Rome, and inherited in Europe —  a system of persuasion techniques, and the two wheels, along with political institutions — , was recepted and used in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain, a period of of progress for parliamentary and journalistic press.

Inspired by Skinner (1996) and Peltonen (2013), the preeminent studies on the history of rhetorical discourse, this research project will also be aware of the differences in the reception of rhetoric in 17th and 18th-century Britain.At the centre of this study is Edmund Burke, who was active in the arena of the Age of Eloquence and was known as the British Cicero. On the other hand, Samuel Johnson —  who, in his obscurity, compiled parliamentary speeches in the *Gentleman's Magazine* and created a template for parliamentary oratory, and James Mackintosh —  who lived through the long 18th century and knew the rhetoric of late 18th and early 19th century Britons well —  are also noted.

From the perspective of reception study, this study will also shed light on how they and their contemporaries read Plutarchus and Tacitus and what they thought about eloquence, parliamentary speeches, or statesmanship. And with them, I would like to consider, for example, the following passage from Plutarchus.

> for such preparation was a mark of deference to the people, whereas heedlessness of what the multitude will think of his speech marks a man of oligarchical spirit, and one who relies on force rather than on persuasion. (Plutarch, *The Parallel Lives*, The Life of Demosthenes)
