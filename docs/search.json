    "text": "Projects\n\n1. The Reception of Rhetoric in Eighteenth‐Century Britain\n\n\nThe research project is to elucidate how rhetoric, which was invented in ancient Greece, developed in ancient Rome, and inherited in Europe — a system of persuasion techniques, and the two wheels, along with political institutions — , was recepted and used in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain, a period of of progress for parliamentary and journalistic press.\nInspired by Skinner (1996) and Peltonen (2013), the preeminent studies on the history of rhetorical discourse, this research project will also be aware of the differences in the reception of rhetoric in 17th and 18th-century Britain.At the centre of this study is Edmund Burke, who was active in the arena of the Age of Eloquence and was known as the British Cicero. On the other hand, Samuel Johnson — who, in his obscurity, compiled parliamentary speeches in the Gentleman’s Magazine and created a template for parliamentary oratory, and James Mackintosh — who lived through the long 18th century and knew the rhetoric of late 18th and early 19th century Britons well — are also noted.\nFrom the perspective of reception study, this study will also shed light on how they and their contemporaries read Plutarchus and Tacitus, not to mention Cicero, and what they thought about eloquence, parliamentary speeches, or statesmanship. And with them, I would like to consider, for example, the enigmatic following passages from Plutarchus and Tacitus.\n\nfor such preparation was a mark of deference to the people, whereas heedlessness of what the multitude will think of his speech marks a man of oligarchical spirit, and one who relies on force rather than on persuasion. (Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Demosthenes)\n\n\nin such times it must be acknowledged that Rome produced a race of noble orators; as in the wild uncultivated field the richest vegetables will often shoot up, and flourish with uncommon vigour. And yet it is fair to ask, Could all the eloquence of the Gracchi atone for the laws which they imposed on their country? Could the fame which Cicero obtained by his eloquence, compensate for the tragic end to which it brought him ? (Tacitus, Dialogue on Oratory)\n\n\nSkinner, Quentin (1996) Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\nPeltonen, Markku (2013) Rhetoric, Politics, and Popularity in Pre-Revolutionary England, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Discourse of Interstate Relations and Empires in Britain during the French Revolution\n\n\nThis study considers discourse on an international sphere in the late eighteenth-century Britain, especially in terms of state, empire and commonwealth. The international turn in intellectual history, which David Armitage announced in 2013, suggests the existence of arenas which “unconfined by the political boundaries of states”. Based on international intellectual history, this study centres on Edmund Burke’s understanding of the International sphere, and uses the reception of Le Droit des gens (Vattel, 1758) as the touchstone of the change in the sphere. Using the law of nations, which had both roles of regulating states in their intercourse with each other and showing the moral obligation of binding human beings, as means to settle international disputes promoted the superiority of state to empire and commonwealth.\nThe French Revolution not only renewed the principles of domestic governance and the logic of integration, but also upset the European order among nations and the idea of international order. This is because they not only physically invaded European countries, but also exported the spirit of the Revolution, and forces that responded to the French Revolution became independent and aimed for a Europe centred on France. A fissure was created between the existing interstate order and the new interstate order. Part of this fissure appeared, in the discursive dimension, over the interpretation of the law of nations.\nHow did the French Revolution affect the understanding of the law of the people of Revolutionary Britain? How did Britain’s politicians and thinkers, many of whom took the side of the “counterrevolution,” use the laws of the people and where did they place their lexical emphasis when conceiving a “counterrevolutionary” international order? To answer this question, this paper examines the understanding of the law of nations by Edmund Burke (1730-1797), who led the theory of a “counterrevolutionary” international order, and James Mackintosh (1765-1832).\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Mackintosh, a leading figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, was the author of A Discourse on the Study of the Law of Nature and Nations, a book that is forgotten today but that attracted the attention of his contemporaries. He was an exceptional political theorist who stayed in the Indian subcontinent. This study organizes his discussion of state, relations between states, and narrative on civilization and barbarism from the discourse, and discusses how these ideas and narrative were or were not utilized by Mackintosh in Bombay. The essay concludes as follows: He used the idea of state in the rule of law and civil society in Bombay. On the other hand, his theory on the law of nations does not have sufficient concepts and language to discuss empire, such as referring to the protectorate of Great Britain as if it were an independent state. This study argues that he, who had the aporia of legitimacy of acquisition and legitimacy of administration, seems to have wandered into a further aporia, by neglecting to discuss the natives in the subcontinent. The author implies that the colonial application of his Enlightenment thought ̶ especially his conception of political economy ̶ was his own answer to getting out of the aporia.\n\n\n\nThe Eloquence in Wartime: Mackintosh on Burke’s Letters on a Regicide Peace\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.34382/00014305\n\n\nAbstract: This paper explores the political context of eloquence in Britain during the French Revolutionary Wars, by examining the controversy on peace with France. Burke’s enigmatic political pamphlet Letters on a Regicide Peace, published for continuing the war in 1796, is one of the most difficult works to interpret. The pamphlet which interweaves threads of rich rhetoric and antagonism toward France has kept scholarship away for a long time. Some scholars have found in the text international theory, and a newly invented word, diplomacy, emphasizing his talent, originality, and innovation. But since they have not paid attention to the reaction from his contemporary, his intention, and the context, the interpretations may be anachronistic. This essay reads the pamphlet in the contemporary controversy, especially with James Mackintosh, who published Vindiciae Gallicae in 1791. His review on Letters on a Regicide Peace, which appeared in Monthly Review in 1796 and refuted Burke’s opinion, has been rarely considered. This paper argues Mackintosh adapted the alternative strategy focusing on Burke’s eloquence or rhetoric, rule of law, and opinions, which were not any subject to Burke. First, after introducing the period background and brief overview of Letters on a Regicide Peace, it shows that Mackintosh warned Burkes’ eloquence by referring to the canonical speeches by Demosthenes and Cicero, and by putting his pamphlet in the context of literature such as The Life of Henry the Fifth (William Shakespeare) and Paradise Regained (John Milton). Second, it focuses on disagreement on the idea of opinions between them. He locked Burke’s perilous gift for eloquence, which incited people to the war persuasively, and called for anti-war.\n\n\n\nThe International Politics of Jealousy: Edmund Burke, Adam Smith and James Mackintosh\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.51054/sgg.2022.8_51\n\n\nAbstract: This paper aims to think about global governance through the classics, focusing on the language, in particular on jealousy, of international relations in Britain during the French Revolutionary Wars. This paper explores perceptions on relations between states of the statesman Edmund Burke (1730-1797) and his contemporaries (the political economist (philosopher) Adam Smith (1723-1790) and the political pamphleteer James Mackintosh (1765-1832) . Through the above discussion, it questions what is “classics” in the study of global governance. It is not common to focus on jealousy in the discussion of global governance and inter-state relations. This is partly because jealousy is not a phenomenon or an analytical concept unique to inter-state relations, such as diplomacy, sovereignty (external sovereignty), balance of power theory, or hegemony, and therefore has been avoided from being discussed head-on. But in today’s relations between states too, jealousy, far from disappearing, continues to be a source of great trouble.This paper finds that Burke, Smith and Mackintosh commonly perceived that inter-state relations were hampered by jealousy, and they all seem to be pessimistic about overcoming jealousy. What is interesting for this paper, however, is Burke has repeatedly expressed concern that other states or nations were jealous of his state. Adam Smith, in arguing for the ‘impartial observer’ in his The Theory of Moral Sentiments, emphasis of the importance of lowering passions to the point where others can follow. It is true that we may not be able to overcome jealousy, but by asking ourselves whether our state is not the object of jealousy from other states, we seem to open the way to cooperative governance with other countries.At any given time, classical texts and later generations does not share preconditions. In this respect, the limitations of this paper do not stem solely from global governance. What is important is that we continue to have a sense of learning from the classics, and that we form a common understanding among contemporaries by sharing the classics, or at least sharing the need to do so. Just as the study of international relations has developed primarily through the classicization of international law, global governance seems to need a corresponding classic. Since the study of global governance has a broader scope than the study of international relations, the scope of the classics should be even broader.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Nations in Britain during the French Revolution: Edmund Burke and James Mackintosh\n\nInstitute of Legal Studies\n\n\n\n\nBook Reviews"
